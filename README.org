#+title: Process History - Extensive history for processes
#+author: Daniel Pettersson
#+language: en

This package advices =make-process= and friends to store command,
working directory, stdout, start time, end time, exit code and vc
revision for all of emacs's sub-processes.

Think =.bash_history= plus plus.

Enable process surveillance with =process-history-mode=.

* Configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package process-history
    :straight (process-history :type git :host github :repo "svaante/process-history"))
    :bind
    ;; Note: This binding overrides default binding for `find-file-read-only'
    ("C-x C-r" . process-history-list)
    :config
    ;; Where to place logs
    ;; (setq process-history-directory "/some/log/dir")

    ;; Which buffers to enable process history for (comes with sensible defaults)
    ;; (add-to-list 'process-history-buffer-match "\\*dape-shell\\*")

    ;; Which buffers to enable process history for (comes with sensible defaults)
    ;; (add-to-list 'process-history-this-command 'shell-command)

    ;; Enable `make-process' advice
    (process-history-mode))
#+end_src

* Note
As this package advices core functionality, usage might have
unintended consequences.  Disable =process-history-mode= at the
first signs of process spawning troubles.

Package takes some inspiration from the excellent package
=detached.el=.
