#+title: Recall - Recall Emacs subprocess
#+author: Daniel Pettersson
#+language: en

This package uses =add-advice= on =make-process= and friends to store
metadata like; working directory, stdout, start time, end time, exit
code and version control revision for Emacs processes.  It defines
commands to view and manage both currently running processes and
historical processes, accessible via the minibuffer and/or a
specialized =tabulated-list= buffer.

Out of the box =recall= supports (see =recall-buffer-match=):
- =async-shell-command=
- =compile=
- =eshell=
- =dired-do-async-shell-command=

Joining the functionality of bash reverse-i-search with =proced=.

Includes integration with =embark= and =consult=.

* Configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package recall
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/svaante/recall")
    :bind
    ;; Note: This binding overrides default binding for `find-file-read-only'
    ("C-x C-r" . recall-list)
    ;; Or if minibuffer completion is your preferable interface
    ("C-x C-r" . recall-rerun)
    :config
    ;; Enable process surveillance
    (recall-mode))
#+end_src

* Note
As this package advices core Emacs functionality, usage might have
unintended consequences.  Disable =recall-mode= at the first signs of
process spawning troubles.

Package is inspired by detached.el
